# Authentication with React Native

A barebones react native application that allows users to sign up / sign in with an email and a password.

## Running the app
Ensure that Xcode is installed/ Android SDK is set up for Mac or Windows respectively.

1. clone
2. `npm install`
3. `react-native run-ios`/ `react-native run-android`

## Notable
* Authentication with firebase
* Application state management (signed up / logged in / logged out) with React component states.
* Leveraging reusable React components.
